    "Notice that calculating the $l_{ij}$'s involves dividing by $u_{ii}$'s. That means in order to avoid potentially catastrophic roundoff errors, or division by zero, we need pivoting. Pivoting is slightly more subtle here than it is during Gaussian elimination. The above procedure assumes no interchanges of rows or columns, that is, no pivoting. In that case, $A=LU$ is strictly true. However to allow for pivoting, the correct identification should realy be $PA=LU$, where $P$ is a permutation matrix that performs all row interchanges (here we only consider partial pivoting by interchanging rows, not columns). If we knew ahead of time which row interchanges were needed for pivoting, we would have \n",

    "  \\tilde{A} = PA = P_{n}P_{n-1}\\cdots P_{2}P_{1}A.\n",

    "\n",
    "It is $\\tilde{A}$, and not $A$, that is factorized into the composition of $L$ and $U$. Of course, we don't know ahead of time which row interchanges are needed for pivoting. So we proceed in a provisional way. We calculate elements using the above expressions until we get to a diagonal element, $u_{jj}$. Then we calculate $u_{jj}$ for all rows on and below the diagonal (i.e., all $u_{ij}$, where $i=j,\\ldots,n$), choose the best pivot candidate among them, and interchange the necessary rows of $A$. Any elements of $L$ that have been determined up to that point are also subject to row interchanges, as are any scale factors associated with $A$. However, elements of $L$ and $U$ that have not yet been determined are unaffected by these row interchanges, under the excuse that they haven't been pinned down yet anyways. This is where the subtlety lies. We are not actually permuting the rows of $L$ or $U$, we are simply re-interpreting their meaning. Remember, we are finding $L$ and $U$ that satisfy $PA=LU$, and not $A=LU$. So when we encounter a pivoting step, we go back and reconsider what $L$ and $U$ *would have been* if the permutation had been made from the outset. This is a bit confusing, so hopefully the example below will illustrate this clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternating between rows and columns is not the only possibility. One may instead sweep through entire columns at a time, starting with the leftmost column and proceeding to the right; or one may sweep through entire rows, starting with the uppermost row and proceeding down. The data used to calculate each element are determined by the time they are needed. In the algorithm below, we will sweep through columns below the diagonal, followed by rows above the diagonal, and then pivoting when we reach a diagonal element. We will use scaled partial pivoting as we did for Gaussian elimination.\n",
    "\n",
    "(PROGRAMMER'S NOTE: each $a_{ij}$ appears exactly once in the above sequence of calculations of either $l_{ij}$ or $u_{ij}$. Therefore once used, it is no longer needed. As a result, there is no need to save the array representing the elements of $A$. Storage requirements can be minimized by replacing the elements of $A$ by the elements of $L$ and $U$, as they are calculated. Also the diagonal elements of $L$ do not need to be stored, since we know that they are simply 1.)"
