    "## 8. Pivoting\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous example illustrates the need for \"pivoting.\" After a forward elimination step, the next diagonal element, say $a_{jj}$, is sometimes zero. When this happens, naive application of the method fails, since the next elimination step $(E_{i} + (a_{ij}/a_{jj})E_{j})\\rightarrow(E_{i})$ requires dividing by $a_{jj}$. The previous example also illustrates the obvious solution: interchange the offending row with some other non-offending row. We saw that the method worked fine when applied to the initial version of the probelm (we never ran into the issue of dividing by zero). When the last two equations take the original order, all is fine. When the order is reversed, dividing by zero is encountered. This shows that the method of Gaussian elimination is sensitive to the ordering of the equations. Therefore at each step in the elimination process, we must check for offending zeros in the leading column, and interchange rows if necessary. This process is called pivoting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pivoting elements that are zero are not the only offenders to be wary of. Equally problematic are pivoting terms that are merely small. Small-valued pivoting elements wreak havoc during the back substitution stage (where they appear in the denominator), leading to an accummulation of roundoff errors that can quickly degrade the accuracy of the solution. (See [2] and [3] for examples that illustrate this.)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different approaches that one may take to pivoting. Arguably the simplest approach is called **partial pivoting**, which involves interchanging of rows only. At the beginning of each elimination step, one checks the leading diagonal term to see if it is an offending term (zero, or small according to some tolerance); if it is, one interchanges that row with the first row below it that does not have an offending element in that same column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pivoting as described above is simple to apply, but it still allows for the accumulation of significant roundoff error. An improved approach is called **scaled**[3] or **implicit**[4] pivoting. The idea is to compare relative magnitudes of pivot candidates that have been normalized to the largest element in each row, rather than a direct comparison of absolute magnitudes. The pivot candidate with the largest relative magnitude wins. The row containing that pivot candidate is then moved to the pivot position.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, define the scale factor for each row of the matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  s_{i} = \\max_{1 \\leq j \\leq n}|a_{ij}|.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "This is calculated just once, at the beginning of the forward elimination stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then at the begining of each elimination step, say at the $j$th column, the relative magnitudes are calculated for each element in that column using\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  p_{ij} = \\frac{|a_{ij}|}{s_{i}}\n",
    "  \\quad,\\quad i = j,\\ldots,n\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "The column element with the largest relative magnitude is selected by identifying the first row index $k$ for which\n",

    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  p_{kj} = \\max_{j \\leq i \\leq n} p_{ij} \n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "If $k=j$, then the row that initially appears in the pivoting position turns out to be the best pivot candidate, and no row interchanges are performed. On the other hand if $k\\neq j$, then a better pivot candidate has been found, and we perform the row interchange $(E_{k})\\leftrightarrow(E_{j})$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "(PROGRAMMER'S NOTE: actual interchanging of rows is unnecessary. Proper ordering of rows can instead be maintained using pointers, minimizing time and memory cost of pivoting. For example, instead of swapping row 3 and row 7, one leaves the array in place and swaps the pointer indices to those rows. The result is that row 3 now has the pointer-index 7, and row 7 now has the pointer-index 3. Instead of swapping two whole rows of an array, one simply swaps two elements in a one-dimensional pointer vector. For large matrices, the additional storage needed to do this bookkeeping more than pays for itself with the storage savings that it provides.) \n",
    "\n",
    "The pivoting process is repeated for each elimination step. When the forward elimination stage is finished, the back substitution stage then proceeds as before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Partial pivoting is not the most conservative (stable) approach to pivoting; it is still susceptible to roundoff error in certain cases. A more conservative approach makes use of interchanging both rows and columns, called **complete**[3] or **full**[4] pivoting. We will not describe the details of complete pivoting here. For now it is enough to know that when choosing a pivoting scheme there is a trade-off between accuracy (stabilty) and speed (computational cost). Here we will take scaled partial pivoting to be an acceptable balance between these competing forces of accuracy and speed."
