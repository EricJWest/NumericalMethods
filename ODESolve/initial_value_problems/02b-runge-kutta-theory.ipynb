Then use knowledge about $\\mathbf{y}_{i}$'s (and possibly derivatives of $\\mathbf{y}$) at \"earlier\" points to approximate (guess) their values at \"later\" points. An approximate solution is found in this way by \"marching\" along the independent variable, starting with the given initial values $\\mathbf{y}_{0}$ at $x_{0}$.\n",
