    "## 1. Summary of the method\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the bisection method, we assume that we have identified an interval $[a,b]$ that brackets a root of $f(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind the secant method is to connect the points $(a,f(a))$ and $(b,f(b))$ by a line, then use the root of that line as an improved approximation of the root of $f(x)$, and repeat. At each iteration, the previous two estimates are used to construct the next secant line. The process is continued until the root is located to within some given tolerance, or some maximum allowed number of iterations is reached.\n",
    " \n",
    "The equation for the line that passes through points $(x_{n-2}, f(x_{n-2}))$ and $(x_{n-1}, f(x_{n-1}))$ is\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  y(x) = \\frac{(f(x_{n-1}) - f(x_{n-2}))}{(x_{n-1} - x_{n-2})}(x - x_{n-1}) + f(x_{n-1})\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "The root of this equation is taken as the next approximation to the root of $f(x)$. This yields the iteration equation \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  x_{n} = x_{n-1} - f(x_{n-1})\\frac{x_{n-1} - x_{n-2}}{f(x_{n-1}) - f(x_{n-2})}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "The relative uncertainty in the location of the root at the end of an iteration is taken to be\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  \\mathsf{REL}\n",
    "  = \\left|\\frac{\\text{(current estimate)} - \\text{(previous estimate)}}{\\text{(current estmate)}}\\right|\n",
    "  = \\left|\\frac{x_{n} - x_{n-1}}{x_{n}}\\right|\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "We should also calculate the error of any proposed root candidate  \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  \\mathsf{ABS} = \\left|f(x_{n})\\right|\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of searching for a root should continue until both of these errors are less than some specified tolerance (or the maximum allowed number of iterations is reached).\n",
    "\n",
    "(PROGRAMMER'S NOTE: when starting from values close to actual root, the secant method often converges faster than the bisection method. However, one drawback is that the secant method does not always keep the root bracketed, and so unlike the bisection method, convergence is not assured. It is therefore advisable to issue a warning any time an iteration occurs when the root is no longer bracketed.)"
