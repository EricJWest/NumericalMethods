    "## 1. Summary of the method\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a function $f(x)$ with one and only one root \"bracketed\" in the interval $[a,b]$. Here bracketed specifically means that the function has opposite signs at the end points of the interval. In other words, $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ have opposite signs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind the bisection method is to divide the bracketing interval in half, determine which subinterval still brackets the root, and repeat. The process is continued until the root is located to within some given tolerance, or some maximum allowed number of iterations is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "The midpoint of the $i$th iteration is found using \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  p_{i} = \\frac{a_{i} + b_{i}}{2} \n",
    "  = a_{i} + \\frac{b_{i} - a_{i}}{2}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "(PROGRAMMER'S NOTE: the second form is prefered, since it is less susceptible to roundoff error. When $b_{i}-a_{i}$ becomes close to machine precision, $(a_{i}+b_{i})/2$ may return a value outside of the interval $[a_{i},b_{i}]$. The second expression for the midpoint does not have this defect.) \n",
    "\n",
    "To determine which half interval the root falls in, define the function\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  \\phi(x_{1},x_{2}) \\equiv \\mathrm{sgn}(f(x_{1}))\\mathrm{sgn}(f(x_{2}))\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "At each iteration, apply this to the left subinterval $\\phi(a_{i-1},p_{i-1})=\\mathrm{sgn}(f(a_{i-1}))\\mathrm{sgn}(f(p_{i-1}))$. There are three cases to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *case i.* $\\phi(a_{i-1},p_{i-1}) < 0$. This means that $f(a_{i-1})$ and $f(p_{i-1})$ have opposite signs, which implies that the root lies in the *left* subinterval $[a_{i-1},p_{i-1}]$. Therefore we choose our new interval to be the left subinterval, setting $[a_{i},b_{i}]=[a_{i-1},p_{i-1}]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- *case ii.* $\\phi(a_{i-1},p_{i-1}) > 0$. This means that $f(a_{i-1})$ and $f(p_{i-1})$ have the same sign, which implies that the root is not in the left subinterval, and therefore must lie in the *right* subinterval $[p_{i-1},b_{i-1}]$. Therefore we choose our new interval to be the right subinterval, setting $[a_{i},b_{i}]=[p_{i-1},b_{i-1}]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- *case iii.* $\\phi(a_{i-1},p_{i-1}) = 0$. This means that the midpoint coincides with the location of the root to within machine precision, and so we're done.\n",
    "\n",
    "(PROGRAMMER'S NOTE: the product $f(a_{i-1})f(p_{i-1})$ could also be used as a test, but it is more more susceptible to overflow/underflow if $f(x)$ becomes too large at either end of the interval.)\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the relative uncertainty in the location of the root at the end of an iteration, take the best estimate of the root, $\\bar{x}$, to be the latest midpoint, and take the absolute uncertainty, $\\delta{x}$, to be the width of the latest interval. The relative error is then calculated as\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  \\mathsf{REL} = \\left|\\frac{\\delta{x}}{\\bar{x}}\\right| \n",
    "  = \\left|\\frac{\\text{(width of current interval)}}{\\text{(midpoint of current interval)}}\\right|\n",
    "  = \\left|\\frac{b_{i} - a_{i}}{p_{i}}\\right|\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "We should also calculate the error of any proposed root candidate  \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  \\mathsf{ABS} = \\left|f(p_{i})\\right|\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of searching for a root should continue until both of these errors are less than some specified tolerance (or the maximum allowed number of iterations is reached).\n",
    "\n",
    "We have assumed that one and only one root is bracketed by the initial interval. Under that condition, the root is always bracketed between two end points, and the interval is ever shrinking. So given enough iterations, the method is guaranteed to converge. The root will eventually be located. Of course, if more than one root lies within the initial interval, the method will find one of them, but there is no guarantee which one.\n",
    "\n",
    "(PROGRAMMER'S NOTE: the assumption that a root is bracketed by the initial interval is crucial. If there is a root in the interval, but it is not bracketed (say if the root is also a minimum or maximum of the function), our sign test will in general fail. Our test assumes that when the sign of the function at two points is the same, there is no root lying between them. A root that is also a minimum or maximum presents a counter-example to this logic. Therefore the bisection method is not equipped to handle this case. As a result, our algorithm should check whether a root is bracketed by the initial interval before applying the method.)"

    "In the spirit of defensive programming, we might employ a slightly more sophisticated check on whether a root of a function is bracketed by the initial interval. We might be blindly handed a function that has more than one root in the initial interval. Or more likely, we might mistakenly choose an initial interval that is either too big (so that it includes multiple roots) or too small (so that it contains no roots). Our algorithm above checks whether the initial interval brackets a root, but it gives no insight in the case of a failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple way to extend our code is to perform an initial search over the given interval for sign changes, which would suggest the presence of bracketed roots. We can make this probe as fancy as we like. Here we just take a brute force approach: divide the interval into $N$ evenly spaced subintervals, and then test each subinterval for a sign change. The routine returns a list of potential bracketed roots. "
