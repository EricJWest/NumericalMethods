    "## 1. Summary of the method\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a function $f(x)$ with one and only one root in the interval $[a,b]$. The idea behind the bisection method is to divide the interval in half, determine which half the root lies in, and repeat. The process is continued until the root is located to within some given tolerance, or some maximum allowed number of iterations is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "The midpoint of the $i$th iteration is found using \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  p_{i} = \\frac{a_{i} + b_{i}}{2} \n",
    "  = a_{i} + \\frac{b_{i} - a_{i}}{2}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "(NOTE: the second form is prefered, since it is less susceptible to roundoff error. When $b_{i}-a_{i}$ becomes close to machine precision, $(a_{i}+b_{i})/2$ may return a value outside of the interval $[a_{i},b_{i}]$. The second expression for the midpoint does not have this defect.) \n",
    "\n",
    "To determine which half interval the root falls in, define the function\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  \\phi(x_{1},x_{2}) \\equiv \\mathrm{sgn}(f(x_{1}))\\mathrm{sgn}(f(x_{2}))\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "At each iteration, apply this to the left subinterval $\\phi(a_{i-1},p_{i-1})=\\mathrm{sgn}(f(a_{i-1}))\\mathrm{sgn}(f(p_{i-1}))$. There are three cases to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *case i.* $\\phi(a_{i-1},p_{i-1}) < 0$. This means that $f(a_{i-1})$ and $f(p_{i-1})$ have opposite signs, which implies that the root lies in the *left* subinterval $[a_{i-1},p_{i-1}]$. Therefore we choose our new interval to be the left subinterval, setting $[a_{i},b_{i}]=[a_{i-1},p_{i-1}]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- *case ii.* $\\phi(a_{i-1},p_{i-1}) > 0$. This means that $f(a_{i-1})$ and $f(p_{i-1})$ have the same sign, which implies that the root is not in the left subinterval, and therefore must lie in the *right* subinterval $[p_{i-1},b_{i-1}]$. Therefore we choose our new interval to be the right subinterval, setting $[a_{i},b_{i}]=[p_{i-1},b_{i-1}]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- *case iii.* $\\phi(a_{i-1},p_{i-1}) = 0$. This means that the midpoint coincides with the location of the root to within machine precision, and so we're done.\n",
    "\n",
    "(NOTE: the product $f(a_{i-1})f(p_{i-1})$ could also be used as a test, but it is more more susceptible to overflow/underflow if $f(x)$ becomes too large at either end of the interval.)\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the relative uncertainty in the location of the root at the end of an iteration, take the best estimate of the root, $\\bar{x}$, to be the latest midpoint, and take the absolute uncertainty, $\\delta{x}$, to be the width of the latest interval. The relative error is then calculated as\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  \\mathsf{REL} = \\left|\\frac{\\delta{x}}{\\bar{x}}\\right| \n",
    "  = \\left|\\frac{\\text{(width of current interval)}}{\\text{(midpoint of current interval)}}\\right|\n",
    "  = \\left|\\frac{b_{i} - a_{i}}{p_{i}}\\right|\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "We should also calculate the error of any proposed root candidate  \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  \\mathsf{ABS} = \\left|f(p_{i})\\right|\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of searching for a root should continue until both of these errors are less than some specified tolerance (or the maximum allowed number of iterations is reached).\n",
    "\n",
    "We have assumed that one and only one root lies within the initial interval. Under that condition, the root is always bracketed between two end points, and the interval is ever shrinking. So given enough iterations, the method is guaranteed to converge. The root will eventually be located. Of course, if more than one root lies within the initial interval, the method will find one of them, but there is no guarantee which one.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is one loophole to this argument. We also have to assume that the root is not a minimum or maximum of the function. A function has the same sign on either side of a minimum or maximum, which our sign test above is not designed to handle. Our test assumes that when the sign of the function at two points is the same, the root is *not* bracketed between them. A root that is also a minimum or maximum presents a counter-example to this assumption. Therefore the bisection method is not equipped to handle this case. \n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to handle these limitations is to demand that $\\phi(a,b) < 0$, that is, the function at one end point must be opposite in sign to the function at the other end point. If this condition is not met, it could mean one of three things\n",
    "\n",
    "- *i.* there are no roots in $[a,b]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *ii.* the root in $[a,b]$ is a minimum or maximum (the function \"turns around\", passing through zero exactly once)\n",
    "\n",
    "- *iii.* there are multiple roots in $[a,b]$ (the function \"turns around\", passing through zero more than once)\n",
    "\n",
    "By requiring $\\phi(a,b) < 0$, and quitting if it is not, we avoid the above problematic cases. For any root-finding problem that meets these criteria, the bisection method is guaranteed to converge to a solution."
