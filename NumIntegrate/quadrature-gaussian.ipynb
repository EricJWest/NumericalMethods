    "\n",
    "for a set of $n$ nodes $x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}$ (note that here we start the counting at 1 instead of 0). We could calculate this using previous quadrature results (e.g., composite Simpson's rule), and be done with it. However, those methods relied on equally spaced nodes. We want to do better by choosing the nodes more intelligently. The question becomes: what is the optimal choice of nodes? More precisely: how can we choose the nodes in order to minimize the expected error in the above approximation?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous methods, the nodes were pre-determined (equally spaced on $[a,b]$), and so only the $n$ coefficients needed finding in order to obtain a quadrature routine. We found these coefficients by requiring that the above approximation held exactly for any polynomial of degree $\\leq n-1$. This requirement gave $n$ conditions, which could then be used to solve for the $n$ unknowns $c_{1},\\ldots,c_{n}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem here is more complicated. We now need to determine $2n$ unknowns: the $n$ coefficients and the locations of the $n$ nodes. The basic idea is to generalize what was done before. Since we now have $2n$ unknowns to determine, we need $2n$ conditions. And so we assume that the above approximation is *exact for any polynomial of degree $\\leq 2n-1$*. This requirement yields the necessary $2n$ conditions, which in principle can be used to solve for the $2n$ unknowns. Easy enough, in theory. Let's see how this works in practice for a simple case.\n",

The short answer is this: the optimal location for the nodes are the zeros of the corresponding orthogonal polynomials on $[a,b]$!!!
